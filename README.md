# Robotic Action and Perception
The current repository contains the code developed for the course [_Robotic Action and Perception_](https://www.miro.ing.unitn.it/category/robotic-perception-and-action/), Masted Degree in Mechatronics Engineering - Department of Industrial Engineering - University of Trento, held by professors De Cecco Mariolino, Luchetti Alessandro. The project is supervised also by Tavernini Matteo, CEO of the startup [_Robosense_](https://www.robosense.it/it/)

## Data
Data files should be put inside the [Data](Data/) folder; in particular should be present the following files:
- `simul_LASER_LASER_SIM.txt`: for each row, contains the 361 measurements of the LIDAR scan in a field of view of 180Â°;
- `simul_LASER_LASER_SIM_times.txt`: each row contains the absolute acquisition time of the respective LIDAR scan in the previous file;
- `simul_ODO.txt`: each line contains the increment of the robot odometry, variables $x,y,\theta$;
- `simul_ODO_times.txt`: each line contains the absolute acquisition time of the respective odometry increment.

In the [Scripts](Scripts/) folder there are developed the main script parts that are then imported in the [main](main.m) file:
- [load_data](Scripts/load_data.m): read laserscan and odometry data. **TODO:** preprocessing of the data in order to create data structures that are more easily accessibles
