# Robotic Action and Perception
The current repository contains the code developed for the course [_Robotic Action and Perception_](https://www.miro.ing.unitn.it/category/robotic-perception-and-action/), Masted Degree in Mechatronics Engineering - Department of Industrial Engineering - University of Trento, held by professors De Cecco Mariolino, Luchetti Alessandro. The project is supervised also by Tavernini Matteo, CEO of the startup [_Robosense_](https://www.robosense.it/it/)


# Laser Rangefinder Navigation


## Data
Data inside the [Data](Data/) folder are obtained by means of the [gridmap navigation simulator](https://www.mrpt.org/list-of-mrpt-apps/application_gridmapnavsimul/) application, an open source software that simulates the mobile robot motion as well as it mesures (with uncertainties); in particular we can generate the following files:
- `simul_LASER_LASER_SIM.txt`: each row contains the measurements of the LIDAR at each time step; in the particular case, the scan has a field of view of 180Â° that's divided in 361 samples;
- `simul_LASER_LASER_SIM_times.txt`: each row contains the absolute acquisition time of the respective LIDAR scan in the previous file;
- `simul_ODO.txt`: each line contains the increment of the robot odometry, variables $x,y,\theta$;
- `simul_ODO_times.txt`: each line contains the absolute acquisition time of the respective odometry increment.

## Repository management
In the [Scripts](Scripts/) folder there are developed the main script parts that are then imported in the [main](main.m) file:
- [load_data](Scripts/load_data.m): read laserscan and odometry data. It also process informations and embeds them in a single cell-array (see later);
- [plot_raw_data](Scripts/plot_raw_data.m): given the cellarray of laserscans in `load_data`, it provides some plots to visualize the raw provided data;


## Data structures
File [`load_data.m`](load_data.m) reads the [data](Data/) and converts all information into suitable structures for further manipulation, in particular:

- `laserscans` is a cell-array of `N_laserscans` object `Laserscan`; while loading, features are already pre-computed.
- `odometries` is a cell-array containing (relative) information of the odometries. Each cell is a struct containing:
    - `x` increment along the _forward direction_;
    - `y` increment along the _lateral direction_;
    - `theta` increment of the robot bearing;
- `laserscans_times` and `odometries_times` are the time vectors of the recorded laserscans and odometries respectively. Their sampling period is `dt_laserscans` and `dt_odometries` (`dt` is the mean sampling period).

**Note:** the extraction of the feature is time consuming, so once files are processed from the script, relevant information are stored in `.mat` files inside the folder `ProcessedData`. Before calling the `load_data.m` script, make sure that 
```matlab
load_precomputed_data = true;
```
is defined. If the flag is set to true, then it firstly tries to load (if available) data from the `ProcessedData` folder, otherwise it computes them from scratch. If the flag is set to false, the algorithm will always re-compute everything at each run.

# Classes
Different classes are developed to get different levels of abstraction of informations. [Naming and ideas mainly obtained by this article (also cited in the references).](https://www.iri.upc.edu/people/jsola/JoanSola/objectes/curs_SLAM/SLAM2D/SLAM%20course.pdf)


### [Laserscan](Classes/Laserscan.m)
Handles information of a laserscan. It takes as input a the polar measurement and is able to convert them in cartesian space. 

Has an algorithm to extract feature from the cartesian map.

**TODO**: create function that given the robot state from which the map has been taken from, it computes the absolute position of each computed feature and it's jacobian (both in local, w.r.t the robot, reference frame and ground, w.r.t the map origin).


### [Odometry](Classes/Odometry.m)
Stores information of the odometry system on the robot.

**TODO**: given the absolute current state of the robot, provide the state update of the Kalman filter.


### [Robot](Classes/Robot.m)
Stores current information of the robot, in particular it's state estimate and covariance matrix.

**TODO**: must create functions to abstract the interaction with the Odometry and Laserscan classes.


### [Observation](Classes/Observation.m)
Observation information: **should we use this clas???**

Maybe can be regarded as the fusion of information coming from the robot (it's state estimate) and the laserscan (features) in order to compute landmarks w.r.t. ground and the associated different relevant Jacobians.


### [Landmark](Classes/Landmark.m)
Contains information (absolute position and covariance matrix) of a landmark inside a map.


### [Map](Classes/Map.m)
Handles everything about the map (landmarks and robot moving inside the map).
